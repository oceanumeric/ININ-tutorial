Another battery pack other than the master battery pack (MP) is set as a slave battery pack (SP). The slave battery pack (SP) transmits the battery state information to the master battery pack (MP). The master battery pack (MP) calculates integrated battery information based on the battery state information of each battery pack.\"@en                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

The method includes: controlling, if a battery level of a battery is less than or equal to a first preset battery level, the electronic device to be in a state in which both a load and the battery are powered by a charging device; and controlling, if the battery level of the battery is greater than or equal to a second preset battery level, the electronic device to be in a state in which neither the load nor the battery is powered by the charging device, and the battery supplies power to the load, where the second preset battery level is greater than the first preset battery level and is less than or equal to a maximum battery level of the battery. In embodiments of this application, when the battery level of the battery is less than or equal to the first preset battery level, the electronic device is controlled to be in the state in which both the load and the battery are powered by the charging device, so that the battery level of the battery increases. When the battery level of the battery is greater than or equal to the second preset battery level, the electronic device is controlled to be in the state in which neither the load nor the battery is powered by the charging device, and the battery supplies power to the load, so that the battery level of the battery decreases. This can avoid that the battery is in a high battery level state for a long time, thereby prolonging a service life of the battery.\"@en\n",
