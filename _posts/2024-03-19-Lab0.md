In this lab, we will use `python` to simulate when two people meet and fall in love. We will then use `R` to analyze the data and visualize the results. The goal of this lab is to get you familiar with the tools we will be using throughout the semester.


## Introduction

Let's say we have the following data

|    | name    | gender   |   age | like_colors   |
|---:|:--------|:---------|------:|:--------------|
|  0 | Romeo   | male     |    16 | red           |
|  1 | Juliet  | female   |    14 | red           |
|  2 | Hamlet  | male     |    30 | blue          |
|  3 | Ophelia | female   |    28 | pink          |


we can assume that Romeo and Juliet will fall in love if their age is within 2 years of each other and they like the same color. Similarly, Hamlet and Ophelia will fall in love if their age is within 5 years of each other and they like the same color.

As this table only have 4 people, the scenario is quite simple. However, in real life, we might have hundreds or thousands of people. In this lab, we will simulate the scenario that will be more realistic.


## Basic structure of a table

To producte the above table in `python`, we can use the following code:

```python
import pandas as pd  # import the pandas library

names = ["Romeo", "Juliet", "Hamlet", "Ophelia"]
gender = ["male", "female", "male", "female"]
ages = [16, 14, 30, 28]
like_colors = ['red', 'red', 'blue', 'pink']

data_dict = {
    "name": names,
    "gender": gender,
    "age": ages,
    "like_colors": like_colors
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data_dict)
```
