title: Lab 0 - Drama of Love

In this lab, we will use `python` to simulate when two people meet and fall in love. We will then use `R` to analyze the data and visualize the results. The goal of this lab is to get you familiar with the tools we will be using throughout the semester.


## Introduction

Let's say we have the following data

|    | name    | gender   |   age | like_colors   |
|---:|:--------|:---------|------:|:--------------|
|  0 | Romeo   | male     |    16 | red           |
|  1 | Juliet  | female   |    14 | red           |
|  2 | Hamlet  | male     |    30 | blue          |
|  3 | Ophelia | female   |    28 | pink          |


we can assume that Romeo and Juliet will fall in love if their age is within 2 years of each other and they like the same color. Similarly, Hamlet and Ophelia will fall in love if their age is within 5 years of each other and they like the same color.

As this table only have 4 people, the scenario is quite simple. However, in real life, we might have hundreds or thousands of people. In this lab, we will simulate the scenario that will be more realistic.


## Basic structure of a table

To producte the above table in `python`, we can use the following code:

```python
import pandas as pd  # import the pandas library

names = ["Romeo", "Juliet", "Hamlet", "Ophelia"]
gender = ["male", "female", "male", "female"]
ages = [16, 14, 30, 28]
like_colors = ['red', 'red', 'blue', 'pink']

data_dict = {
    "name": names,
    "gender": gender,
    "age": ages,
    "like_colors": like_colors
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data_dict)
```

Here is the [link from ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/64661c26-5f92-4ffd-b8cb-62ac8f535a60){:target="_blank"} for explanation of the code above.

This kind of table in `python` and `R` is called a `dataframe`. We can think of a dataframe as a table where each row is an observation and each column is a variable. In this case, we have 4 observations and 4 variables.

## Making a simulation

Now, suppose we have generate a list of 1000 people with random ages and colors they like. Names are generated randomly as well. We can write a function to match people who fall in love. The following table shows the matching results for `lxlnvo`.

|    | Name   |   Age | Like_Color   | Gender   |   age_diff_with_lxlnvo | color_match_with_lxlnvo   |
|---:|:-------|------:|:-------------|:---------|-----------------------:|:--------------------------|
|  0 | lxlnvo |    41 | yellow       | Female   |     None                   |                None           |
|  1 | sdvkqx |    34 | orange       | Male     |                      7 | False                     |
|  2 | zazcre |    20 | yellow       | Male     |                     21 | True                      |
|  3 | xpksnc |    22 | indigo       | Male     |                     19 | False                     |
|  4 | yiqdxn |    24 | red          | Male     |                     17 | False                     |


## A little bit psychology

To make our simulation more realistic, we will add five factors that could 'define'
our personality:

- **Openness**: How open-minded a person is.
- **Conscientiousness**: How organized and responsible a person is.
- **Extraversion**: How outgoing and social a person is.
- **Agreeableness**: How kind and compassionate a person is.
- **Neuroticism**: How sensitive and nervous a person is.

For each factor, we will assume it is a continuous variable between 0 and 100, where 0 is the lowest and 100 is the highest. **We also assume that the value of each factor is normally distributed.**

$$
\text{Factor} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 50, \sigma = 10)
$$

where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. We could use the following function to generate number from normal distribution:

```python
import random

# change the value of mu and sigma to get different results
random.gauss(mu, sigma)
```

The following figure shows the shape of the normal distribution if you have forgotten.

Here is the result we generate:
