In this lab, we will use `python` to simulate when two people meet and fall in love. We will then use `R` to analyze the data and visualize the results. The goal of this lab is to get you familiar with the tools we will be using throughout the semester.


## Introduction

Let's say we have the following data

|    | name    | gender   |   age | like_colors   |
|---:|:--------|:---------|------:|:--------------|
|  0 | Romeo   | male     |    16 | red           |
|  1 | Juliet  | female   |    14 | red           |
|  2 | Hamlet  | male     |    30 | blue          |
