This is the third year that I am giving the ININ tutorial. With the advances in AI, I am always looking for ways to improve the teaching experience. Last year, I have used the GitHub Copilot to show students how programming can be made easier with AI. This year, I am going to make the course more interactive by constructing a website that students can use to follow the course material, follow the links to interact with ChatGPT and run the code in a Jupyter notebook environment.

Ideally, I would like to have a course that is self-contained and self-paced. Students can follow the course material at their own pace, ask questions to ChatGPT when they are stuck, and run the code in a Jupyter notebook environment to see the results. This way, they can learn by doing and get immediate feedback on their work.

For students, this is a great way to learn new things. For me, it is a nice way to
present the course material and interact with the students. **Most importantly, both
teaching and learning process have to be driven by AI and fun!** So, in this course,
you will have:

- a website to follow the course material, to read the blog posts, and to interact with ChatGPT.
- A website that includes youtube videos, code snippets, math equations, and images.
- A repository where you can find the code and exercises.
- A coding environment where you can run the code and see the results.

Here is our roadmap for the course:

- Lab 0: Get to know `Github`, `Jupyter`, `Python` and `R`
    - This is a lab where you will learn how to use `Github`, `Jupyter`, `Python` and `R`.
    - Most of time, you just need to run the code that I have written for you.
    - The theme of the lab is about 'Drama of Love`. 

- Lab 1: Enter the world of Patents
    - This is a lab where you will learn how to query patents from the EPO Linked Open Data.
    - You will learn the basic structure of a patent document, such as title, abstract, claims, and description, etc.
    - You will learn how patent could help us to understand the technology landscape, such as the technology trend of electric vehicles and AI.

- Lab 2: More about Patents and Community Innovation Survey
    - We will do more analysis on patents
    - We will also learn how to use the Community Innovation Survey to understand the innovation activities of firms.

- Lab 3: Regression Analysis
    - We will learn how to do regression analysis 
    - We will learn how to do regression diagnostics

- Lab 4: Innovation and Institutions
    - We will use a dataset from a published paper to understand the relationship between innovation and institutions.
    - After this lab, you will have a better understanding of how to use data to answer research questions.

- Lab 5: Presentation and Writing with Copilot
    - We will learn how to use Copilot to create a presentation and write a paper.
    - You will also learn how to use Latex to manage your references and write a paper
    with very professional looking.


All learning materials will be posted on this website and [this repository](https://github.com/oceanumeric/ININ-tutorial){:target="_blank"}.



## Some Formatting Examples

The following content is just to show you some formatting examples, which I hope will make your learning experience more enjoyable.

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

You can write `bash` code:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

You can write `sql` code:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table
WHERE column = 'value';
```

Let's try some math:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} &= \frac{5}{6} \\
\end{align*}
$$

You can even do math inline: $1 + 1 = 2$ or matrix multiplication:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
5 & 6 \\
7 & 8
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
19 & 22 \\
43 & 50
\end{bmatrix}
$$


## Using ChatGPT in the Course

From time to time, I will share links like this one:

- [ChatGPT Reading Mater](https://chat.openai.com/share/6cb183e1-68de-41a3-837a-50a4d2482bc9){:target="_blank"}

You can click on the link and interact with ChatGPT. It is a great way to learn new things and get help with the course material.
