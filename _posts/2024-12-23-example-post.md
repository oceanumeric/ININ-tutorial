This is an example post.

You can write `python` code:

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

You can write `bash` code:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

You can write `sql` code:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table
WHERE column = 'value';
```

Let's try math:

$$
\begin{align*}
\dot{x} & = \sigma(y-x) \\
\dot{y} & = \rho x - y - xz \\
\dot{z} & = -\beta z + xy
\end{align*}
$$
