This is an example post.

You can write `python` code:

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

You can write `bash` code:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

You can write `sql` code:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table
WHERE column = 'value';
```

Let's try some math:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} &= \frac{5}{6} \\
\end{align*}
$$
