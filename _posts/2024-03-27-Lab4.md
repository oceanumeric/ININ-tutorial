In this lab, we will replicate the results of a well-known paper: Innovation and institutional ownership. The paper was published in the American Economic Review in 2013 by 
Philippe Aghion, John Van Reenen, and Luigi Zingales. The paper is available [here](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.1.277). You can also find it in the `papers` folder in the course repository.
