In this lab, we will guide you through the process of

- knowing the basics of patents
- how to analyze the patent data
- understanding the patent data
- where to find the patent data


## Basics of Patents

The best way to learn the basics of patents is to check one example:

- patent name: *Exosome-mediated diagnosis of hepatitis virus infections and diseases*
- read the patent via [this link](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/original-document?channel=espacenet_channel-581d4bf1-4a43-4a7c-8f2d-fd9a1a74bf7a)
- see how long it takes and how much energy it takes to apply for a patent via [this link](https://register.epo.org/ipfwretrieve?apn=US.201615377054.A&lng=en)
- you can search for patents via [this link](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/?locale=en_EP)


## Analyzing the patent data

In the lab, you will use `R` to query and analyze the patent data. We will not go through
the process here as we will do it in the lab together. Here I will just show what
you can expect to see in the lab.

Last year, the Economist published an article called 'How Japan is losing the global
electric-vehicle race'.

The following paragraph is taken from the article:

> Japan also made an early wrong turn with hydrogen, another emergent auto technology with the potential to be carbon-free. Toyota, Japan’s most influential carmaker, bet that using hydrogen fuel-cells would become the leading way to electrify cars. Abe Shinzo, Japan’s prime minister from 2012 to 2020, championed policies to make Japan a “hydrogen society”; in 2015, Toyota delivered its first hydrogen fuel-cell sedan, the Mirai, to Abe himself. While hydrogen may come to play a big role in decarbonising hard-to-electrify sectors, such as steel production or fuelling long-haul trucks, it has so far turned out to make little sense as a technology to electrify light consumer vehicles. Even in Japan, which has built a fair amount of hydrogen-refuelling infrastructure, Toyota has struggled to peddle the pricey Mirai: the company has sold a total of just 7,500 fuel-cell vehicles in its home market.
